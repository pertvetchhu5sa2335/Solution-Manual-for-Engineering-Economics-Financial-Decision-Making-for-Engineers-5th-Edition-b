  * Engineering Financial Decision Making for Engineers¿ is designed for teaching a course on engineering economics to match engineering practice today. It recognizes the role of the engineer as a decision maker who has to make and defend sensible decisions. Such decisions must not only take into account a correct assessment of costs and benefits, they must also reflect an understanding of the environment in which the decisions are made. The 5 th edition has new material on project management in order to adhere to the CEAB guidelines as well the new edition will have a new spreadsheet feature throughout the text.\
